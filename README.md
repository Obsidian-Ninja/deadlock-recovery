Deadlock Recovery Strategies in C++, Python, and JavaScript
Overview
This repository provides a collection of deadlock prevention, detection, and recovery strategies implemented in C++, Python, and JavaScript. Deadlocks occur frequently in concurrent systems, where threads or processes become stuck due to circular dependencies on resources. This project aims to provide easy-to-understand examples and reusable modules for handling deadlocks in different programming languages.

Features
Implementations across C++, Python, and JavaScript for easy adaptation in various projects.
Deadlock handling approaches including prevention, detection, and recovery.
Modular code structure for reusability and easy integration.

Implemented Strategies

1. Deadlock Prevention
Resource Ordering: Ensures resources are acquired in a consistent order to prevent circular dependencies.
Banker's Algorithm: Checks for safe resource allocation.

2. Deadlock Detection
Wait-For Graph (WFG): Tracks process dependencies to detect cycles.
Resource Allocation Graph: Visualizes resource allocation to detect potential deadlocks.

3. Deadlock Recovery
Process Termination: Ends selected processes to break deadlock cycles.
Resource Preemption: Forcibly releases and reallocates resources.
